  <!--  this bean is currently used through a static method call when
        called from other shared services. For this use case, there is no
        need to define the bean as we have done below. 
        However, when the rights-service is being used within the context of a web-app,
        we definitely want to initialize it here because it implements the 
        ApplicationContextAware interface which allows this bean to reference
        the application context that owns it.
