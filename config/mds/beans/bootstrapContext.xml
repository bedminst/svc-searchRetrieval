  <!--  this bean is currently used through a static method call when
        called from other shared services. For this use case, there is no
        need to define the bean as we have done below. 
        When the services are being used within the context of a web-app
        however, we do want to initialize it here because it implements the 
        ApplicationContextAware interface and we want the bean to know 
        the application context that owns it.
